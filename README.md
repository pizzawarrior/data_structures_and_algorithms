## The Famous 'Grokking the Coding' Set of Data Structures and Algorithms!

**Purpose**
- To get friendlier and friendlier with advanced algorithms and data structures, in the pursuit of better performance and understanding.
- To improve upon the 'accepted' responses commonly found in CodeWars, LeetCode, etc., which are often not very performant and/ or can be hacky one-liners.
- Just because you can get a program to pass a test doesn't mean you have any engagement with WHY you used an array instead of a hashmap. This exercise aims to make those selections more deliberate, and enhance my own personal understanding.
- Practice makes Happy! (Do we really ever think we are going to be perfect??)

**Contents**
- Your usual common patterns and data structures, with an approach that alternates JavaScrpt and Python. (Gotta stay sharp!)
- Each common pattern folder has a file called 'intro.md' which describes what the pattern is, how it works, and an example of what it is commonly used for.

**Remember**
- This is supposed to be fun!
