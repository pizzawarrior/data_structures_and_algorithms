## Fast and Slow Pointers

* AKA Hare and Tortoise algorithm
* Uses 2 pointers to move through an array/ sequence/ linked list at different speeds
* By moving at different speeds (eg. cyclic linked list) the algo is set up such that the 2 pointers are bound to meet up
* The fast pointer should 'catch' the slow pointer once they are in a cyclic loop
**Example** Finding a cycle in a linked list
