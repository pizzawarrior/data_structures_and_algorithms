This pattern describes a technique to deal with overlapping intervals.
In a lot of problems dealing with intervals we either need to find overlapping intervals, or merge intervals if they overlap.

Given two intervals, ('a' and 'b') there will be 6 different ways the two intervals can relate to each other.
1. a and b do not overlap
2. a and b do overlap; b ends after a
3. a completely overlaps b
4. a and b overlap; a ends after b
5. b completely overlaps a
6. a and b do NOT overlap
